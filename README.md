# WhoWantsRubbish--Landing
# User Search Website

A website built using React and Bootstrap this is a landing page for my upcoming project for the re-use of typical business and household waste products. This website will feature the ability to
create listings where businesses can request donations of typical waste household and other business products. Users will create an account and be able to contact businesses to arrange donations.
The aim of this is to reduce the waste to landfill, flytipping and encourage upcycling of products. This could be used to request donations for lcothing, stationary products for schools, or expired first aid supplies for animal shelters 
to name but a few possibilities. 

The landing page is now available for email sign-ups and to browse the websites aim and mission.
